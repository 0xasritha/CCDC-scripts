#TODO: separate out service accounts 

New-AdServiceAccount # is there a difference between these service accounts and the accounts for like third party Service accounts like WRDCCDC ? 

<# 
- list groups (separate out ones created by default) + users within each group? 
- properites of each group? 
- list OUs (seperate out the ones created by default, so just the DC one) 
- would be able to get all DCs by looking in the Domain Controllers OU 
- user vs computer vs group accounts? 

I should know how to create my own OUs
